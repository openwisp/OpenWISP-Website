        <h2>General suggestions and warnings</h2>

        <ul class="ui bulleted link list">
          <li>
            <strong>some details may be missing from the project idea</strong>:
            we expect students to do their own research, propose solutions,
            and be ready to deal with uncertainty and solve challenges
            that may come up during the project
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              code and prototypes are preferred over detailed documents
              and unreliable estimates:
            </strong>
            rather than wasting your time on writing a very long application document,
            we suggest you to invest in writing a prototype (which means the code
            may be thrown out entirely) which will help you understand the challenges
            of the project you want to work on;
            your application should refer to the prototype or other github
            contributions you made to OpenWISP that show you have the capability
            to succeed in the project idea you are applying for
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>accepted students will have to create github issues and
            a kanban board on github for their project</strong>:
            the requirements listed in the idea page will have to be converted
            into github issues which shall be tracked from a kanban board on github
            to allow the openwisp community to easily keep track of the project progress
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="docker">Dockerization of OpenWISP 2</h2>
        <p><strong>Languages &amp; technologies used:</strong> Python, Bash, Docker, Docker Compose, OpenVPN.</p>

        <p>
        	The current automated <a href="https://github.com/openwisp/ansible-openwisp2">
          deployment procedure for OpenWISP 2 is based on Ansible</a> and has served
          us well until today but has some limitations that make it unsuited for
          more complex deployments that need horizontal scaling, custom setups
          and easily replicable deployments.
        </p>

        <p>
        	This project idea aims to develop an automated deployment procedure
          based on Docker and Docker Compose, mixing in also other technologies
          like Python and Shell scripts to glue together all the pieces needed
          to achieve it.
        </p>

        <p>
          We also aim to provide a fully working OpenWISP instance that
          includes a management VPN (based on OpenVPN) that works out
          of the box and is pre-configured in OpenWISP.
        </p>

        <p>
          Keep in mind that some parts of some OpenWISP may need to be changed
          to make the dockerization easier, so if you want to work on this
          project you must be familiar with changing the internals of OpenWISP modules.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Feel free to suggest some tools or technologies
          to solve specific problems if you think it's appropriate
          and would be beneficial, keeping in mind that
          we want to keep things as simple as possible</strong>.

        <ul class="ui bulleted link list">
            <li>
                Create one or more set of images based on Alpine Linux and python 3.7
                which have all the python packages needed for the different services.<br>
                Find out the right balance between efficiency, configurability and
                simplicity by leveraging the docker features like base images,
                build arguments, multi stage builds and any other tool that may
                be useful to create a good set of docker images.<br>

                    <li>
                        Provide the OpenWISP Admin interface and the views
                        managing account information (password reset, email confirmation)
                        in a dedicated container.

                    <li>
                        Provide the OpenWISP Controller (<code>connections</code> branch)

                    <li>Provide the websocket server of OpenWISP in a dedicated container</li>
                    <li>Provide a celery worker, initially used only by OpenWISP Controller
                        (<code>connections</code> branch), but which later will executes background
                        tasks of other modules as well, in a dedicated container.
                    </li>
                    <li>Provide a dedicated container for celery-beat
                        (used to automatically execute background tasks periodically)

                    <li>
                        Provide a default management VPN based on OpenVPN in a dedicated container.
                        The VPN shall be also pre-configured in OpenWISP, both as a VPN Server
                        and a related VPN client template
                        (ask questions to your mentors to know more about this),
                        the OpenVPN configuration used in the container shall be kept in sync with the
                        definition available in the VPN Server of OpenWISP.
                        The Certificate Revocation List of the VPN shall be
                        downloaded periodically from openwisp on the filesystem (a script run in a crontab)
                        of the VPN server and the configuration of the VPN server

                    <li>
                        Provide mounted volumes that allow to store persistently
                        files that are uploaded by users (eg: floor plan images).
                    </li>
                    <li>Provide the OpenWISP Radius views and APIs in a dedicated container</li>

                    <li>
                        Provide a dedicated container with an nginx instance which
                        has HTTP 2, IPv6 and Gzip enabled by deafult
                        (but can be turned off if needed)
                        that dispatches HTTP requests to the different containers,
                        depending on which domain is called
                        (eg: dashboard.mydomain.com for the admin container,
                         controller.mydomain.com for openwisp-controller container
                         and so on);
                        Allow to provide custom settings for each site.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ensure each OpenWISP module and its related services

                    <li>
                        Provide a PostgreSQL instance in a dedicated container,
                        ensure all the other services point to this postgres
                        instance, ensure the data is stored on persistent storage,
                        allow using a PostgreSQL hosted elsewhere as an alternative
                        (some users may want to use managed PostgreSQL services)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Provide a redis instance in a dedicated container
                        and ensure the django settings point to it
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Provide a deafult working postfix instance which is
                        able to send emails but can also be turned off
                        (users may want to use an external SMTP service)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                The different containers may have very similar or some times
                identical django settings but we need to absolutely avoid
                having to manually maintain duplicated settings;
                find a way to manage the django settings of OpenWISP efficiently
                and in a way that allows to avoid duplication between the
                different services
            </li>
            <li>
                Customizability: it should be possible to use custom Docker images
                and custom django settings for OpenWISP in order to ensure that
                different users can deploy their tailored OpenWISP based
                network automation solution
            </li>
            <li>
                Allow users to easily configure some django settings:
                <ul>
                    <li>CORS settings</li>
                    <li>Sentry logging (including the celery container)
                        using the more recent <code>sentry_sdk</code>
                        (in ansible-openwisp2 we use the old pyhon-raven module)
                    </li>
                    <li>DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL</li>
                    <li>SMTP settings</li>
                    <li>language code</li>
                    <li>timezone</li>
                    <li>Leaflet settings</li>
                    <li>default cert validity for django-x509</li>
                    <li>default CA validity for django-x509</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Implement automated testing with basic checks for each service,
                eg: for the admin interface, send and HTTP request expecting to see the login page
                (at least one similar checks should be implemented for each service);
                the tests shall be executed in a travis-ci build
            </li>
            <li>
                Include installation, upgrade and usage information as well as
                an explanation of configuration settings in the README.

        <h2 id="login-page">
          React based WiFi Login Page with Auto-Login Feature
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Languages &amp; technologies used:</strong>
          ReactJS, NodeJS, HTML5, CSS and Javascript ES6 for the login page app,
          Python and Django to edit django-freeradius and openwisp-radius.
        </p>
        <p>
          WiFi services most often make use of a login page
          (a.k.a captive page)
          that is used to allow users to authenticate,
          sign up and know more about the
          WiFi service they are using.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few years ago we developed a configurable login page
          that is configured and built via ansible:
          <a href="https://github.com/openwisp/ansible-freeitaliawifi-login-page">
            ansible-freeitaliawifi-login-page
          </a>
        </p>
        <p>
          In this project idea we want to use that work as a base to improve
          upon that concept and integrate the result in the official OpenWISP toolset.
        </p>
        <p>
          While using the current login page we encountered limitations that
          we aim to overcome with a different solution that will allow us to
          achieve more advanced features and more maintenability.
        </p>
        <p>
          To achieve the goals of this project some small modifications
          to django-freeradius/openwisp-radius will be needed, so we
          encourage students interested in this project idea to become
          familiar with those two modules of OpenWISP.
        </p>

        <ul class="ui bulleted link list">
          <li>
            Implement a React.js based login page with a feature set that is similar
            to <a href="https://github.com/openwisp/ansible-freeitaliawifi-login-page">
              ansible-freeitaliawifi-login-page
            </a>
          </li>
          <li>
            The code shall be based on ES6 and transpiled with babel.js for old browsers
          </li>
          <li>
            The software shall provide a backend part implemented in Node.js,
            which also serves as a proxy for all asynchronous (a.k.a. Ajax)
            HTTP requests that need to be made to external services
            (obtaining auth token, sign up, etc.); a configurable time-out
            should be set for all the external requests, defaulting to 2 seconds
            and the failure scenarios should be handled by displaying a nice
            error message to the user
          </li>
          <li>
            Provide in-browser automated testing with a modern and widely used solution
            based on javascript<br>
            Waiting the end of the project to begin this task is not acceptable
          </li>
          <li>
            Ensure automated tests, code coverage, code-quality checks
            (JSHint, CSS linter, HTML linter) are executed automatically
            in a travis-ci build that is run on each commit<br>
            Waiting the end of the project to begin this task is not acceptable
          </li>
          <li>
            Prepare a README with installation, upgrade and usage instructions<br>
            Waiting the end of the project to begin this task is not acceptable
          </li>
          <li>
            Provide support for multiple organizations: the look and feel of the page
            must be configurable as follows
            <ul>
              <li>
                Each organization shall be reachable at its own URL path,
                eg: <code>https://&lt;domain&gt;/&lt;organization&gt;</code>
              </li>
              <li>
                Only relative paths shall be used (to load CSS, JS, images, provide internal links),
                so that it will be possible to use nginx to reverse proxy
                specific domain names to a specific organization
              </li>
              <li>
                Since different organizations have different needs, different logos,
                different themes, different languages, different features,
                most of the configuration options of this project must be
                editable at organization level, but since some settings may be
                identical for each organization it should also be possible
                to define the default settings at a general level
              </li>
              <li>
                An optional feature, disabled by default,
                shall perform an asynchronous HTTP call to a specific URL
                before the page is displayed to the user, depending on the
                response returned by this URL the page may be displayed or not:<br>
                <strong>case 1</strong>: if the response is positive,
                the user can see the login page;<br>
                <strong>case 2</strong>: if the response is negative,
                the user cannot see the login page because they are not
                directly connected to the public wifi service
                (it means the login page is being accessed from a normal
                internet connection, think about your house or your
                4G connection);<br>
                <strong>case 3</strong>: if the request times out, the

              <li>
                The login form shall authenticate users
                using the openwisp-radius "obtain auth token" API endpoint
                and use this token as a password that will be sent to the
                captive portal, usually Coova-Chilli or PfSense
                (a code sample will be provided)
              </li>
              <li>
                If the authentication fails (eg: wrong password), the error

                After successful login, the user shall be redirected to an internal
                status page which displays a success message and informs the user

              </li>

                The status page shall provide a link to where users can

                At successful login, the backend code should obtain a new

                (eg: with a secret key that is different
                for each organization and is accessible only by the backend, or
                an equivalent secure way) and

              <li>
                When user comes back to the login page, if the cookie containing
                the encrypted token is detected by the backend, the user token
                shall be decrypted and used to check if it's
                valid and if the user needs to be authenticated again
                (this implies adding a new API endpoint in
                django-freeradius/openwisp-radius);<br>

        <h2 id="template-library">OpenWISP Template Sharing &amp; Template Library</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Languages &amp; technologies used:</strong>
          Python and Django on the OpenWISP side,
          ReactJS, NodeJS, Javascript ES6, HTML5 and CSS for the template library.
        </p>

        <p>
          The goal of this project idea is to implement features that will allow
          templates to be shared across different OpenWISP instances, as well as
          allow templates to be collected in a template library, one of which
          will be published and linked from the openwisp website.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Measurable outcomes:</strong></p>
        <ul class="ui bulleted link list">
          <li>
            Modify django-netjsonconfig and openwisp-controller to share templates:
            <ul>
              <li>the template can be flagged as private
                  (it would work as it does now)</li>
              <li>the template can be flagged as shared publicly</li>
              <li>the template can be flagged as shared with a secret key that
                  will used to build a link that is shared with only those who know it
                  (like google docs link sharing)</li>
              <li>the template can be flagged as taken from an external source,
                  in that case additional fields should be provided to allow users
                  to specify the URL and the settings of the template
              </li>
              <li>if the template is shared (publicly or link-sharing),
                  its contents serialized to JSON will be available via an API endpoint;<br>
                  <b>public template example:</b> <code>/api/v1/templates/&lt;uuid&gt;/</code><br>
                  <b>private template example:</b> <code>/api/v1/templates/&lt;uuid&gt;/?key=&lt;key&gt;</code><br>
              </li>
              <li>
                a <code>description</code> text field shall be added to the <code>Template</code> model;
                this field shall be used for the public description of the shared templates
                (explain this in the <code>help_text</code>)
              </li>
              <li>
                a <code>notes</code> text field shall be added to the <code>Template</code> model;
                this field shall be used only for internal notes for the administrators
                (explain this in the <code>help_text</code>)
              </li>
              <li>
                shared templates will likely contain mostly variables (for example,
                imagine a coova-chilli captive portal configuration, the captive page URL,
                interface name, radius ip and ports will always differ for each user
                that wants to use the shared template), this may
                cause the backend validation to fail because variables are not recognized;
                find a way to overcome this problem, for example, sample values
                for each variable may be provided by the designer of the template
                and these values can be substituted to the variables so the
                validation doesn't fail, this means the template designer user
                should be allowed to fill these variables in some way
              </li>
              <li>
                templates taken from external sources will likely contain
                variables that have to be filled by the user which imports
                that template from the external source, this means that
                the admin UI of OpenWISP should allow the user to fill these
                variables in some way; the list of variables may also be
                provided by the instance which shares the template
              </li>
              <li>
                add an API endpoint in django-netjsonconfig which lists all
                the available public templates; include the possibility to
                perform a search in the name and description
              </li>
              <li>
                add an API endpoint to openwisp-controller which lists all
                the available public templates for each organization,
                using the API endpoint of django-netjsonconfig described in
                the previous point as base class;
                openwisp-controller should also provide an API endpoint
                which lists all the available templates for all the
              </li>
              <li>
                there are other objects in OpenWISP which provide a key field,
                the same logic should be reused in this project,

              <li>
                edit the Template model and admin to allow specifying a URL
                from which the template contents should be taken from;<br>
                remember to manage the failure case (eg: the URL is not reachable,
                the retrieved content is unusable or there's a validation error);<br>
                we shall add a switcher in the admin that explicitly asks the user
                to choose whether the template contents will be defined by themselves
                or be taken from an external source, the switcher logic shall be
                similar to the switcher we already have in django-x509 for
                new vs imported certificates, see the implementation:<br>

                when a user adds an external template successfully, the application
                shall start a background celery task that notifies the target

              <li>
                implement the necessary API endpoint and model changes needed
                to receive notifications about subscriptions and unsubscriptions
                so that we can keep some statistics; each subscription should
                be stored in its own database record and should keep track of:
                template id (<code>ForeignKey</code> pointing to <code>Template</code> model),

              </li>

                add a Celery beat task to sync contents of external templates periodically;
                keep in mind the instance which sends the API request to sync its contents
                should do it in a way that lets the external source know that it should

        	The library kinda worked but was not brought to production level work
        	and since OpenWISP 2 is going to have a monitoring system soon, wa want
        	to rewrite this library to bring its implementation to production level.
        </p>

        <p>
        	<strong>NOTE</strong>: backward compatibility does not have to be maintained
        	we can freely change and improve the API and internal structure of the library
        	if we think the change is going to improve the quality of the implementation.
        </p>

        <p>
        	<strong>WARNING</strong>: to work on this project you need an AirOS device;
        	OpenWRT can be installed in a virtual box VM, but AirOS cannot (at least
        	not as easily). If you don't have an AirOS device compatible with the latest
        	version and you do not indend to buy one you cannot work on this project.<br>
        	If it ever happens that you get accepted but you fail to buy an AirOS device,
        	you will be failed.

        <p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible">Ansible</a> is an IT automation tool that has been recently
        gaining popularity also in the <a class="reference external" href="http://openwrt.org">OpenWRT</a> world.</p>
        <p>We want to implement an ansible plugin that integrates <a class="reference external" href="http://netjsonconfig.openwisp.org">netjsonconfig</a>
        and allows using its two most interesting features, that is templates and context, in ansible.</p>
        <p>It should be possible to define configuration templates, assign them to specific playbooks and define
        specific configurations for hosts.</p>
        <p>The configuration format format used by netjsonconfig is <a class="reference external" href="http://netjson.org/docs/what.html#deviceconfiguration">NetJSON DeviceConfiguration</a>, but a <em>YAML</em>
        conversion of <em>NetJSON</em> would be good as well. Support for both would be preferred.</p>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/interop-dev/netjsongraph.js">netjsongraph.js</a> is a javascript library based on d3 that allows visualization of
        <a href="http://netjson.org/docs/what.html#networkgraph">NetJSON NetworkGraph objects</a>.</p>
        <p>
        	The library uses SVG for visualization, which can be quite slow when many elements are shown,
        	therefore we would like to try switching to canvas.<br>
        	We also need an optional mode in which the network is displayed on a map.</p>
        <p>
        	We aim at building something like <a href="https://regensburg.freifunk.net/meshviewer/#/en/graph">mesh viewer</a>
        	with the difference that this is a library and not an application.<br>
        	We want to give developers the possibility to implement features like those of mesh-viewer
        	in their application without reinventing the weel <b>BUT</b> we also want to integrate
        	these features in OpenWISP 2, infact we are already using the current <i>netjsongraph.js</i> version
        	in our network topology module, for more information see

        <h2 id="netjson-ubus">Implement NetJSON output in ubus (OpenWRT/LEDE)</h2>
        <p><a href="http://netjson.org">NetJSON</a> is emerging as a common format to exchange configuration and monitoring information
        from network devices. Year after year it's becoming easier to achieve interoperability between different software packages
        for networking software. Now is time to start implementing NetJSON in a lower level of the stack and the next
        natural step in that direction is to implement it in <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/ubus">ubus (OpenWrt micro bus architecture)</a>,
        which is included by default in <a href="https://openwrt.org/">OpenWRT</a>, the two linux distributions
        commonly used with OpenWISP.
        </p>
        <p>In this project the student will have to develop ubus API extensions that allow retrieving monitoring informatio in NetJSON format
        	(<a href="http://netjson.org/docs/what.html#devicemonitoring">NetJSON DeviceMonitoring</a>) from ubus.
