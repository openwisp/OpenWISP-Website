        <h2 id="django-radius">openwisp-radius: integrating django-freeradius in OpenWISP 2</h2>
        <p><strong>Languages &amp; technologies used:</strong> python, django, freeradius, django-rest-framework, ansible.</p>

        <p>One of the most important features missing in OpenWISP 2 is the <strong>AAA</strong> (Authorization, Authenticatio and Accounting),
        which in OpenWISP 1 is implemented with <a href="https://github.com/openwisp/OpenWISP-User-Management-System">OpenWISP User Management System</a> from now on (OWUMS).</p>
        <p>In 2017 we worked on the base module of OpenWISP 2: <a href="https://github.com/openwisp/django-freeradius">django-freeradius</a>, now is time to improve django-freeradius and integrate it in the OpenWISP 2 ecosystem.</p>

        <p><strong>Measurable outcomes:</strong></p>
        <ul class="ui bulleted link list">
            <li>
        				add a way to enforce session limits (traffic limit, session time limit) in a similar way
        			  as OWUMS does, using radius groups
        		</li>
        		<li>
        				add a way to import users from CSV, first via a management command,
        				then via the django admin
        		</li>
            <li>
        			add optional ways to restrict API usage for security reasons, eg: token authentication, ip range;
        			the default behaviour should allow the application to work out of the box without additional configuration
        		</li>
        		<li>
        			integrate django-freeradius in the rest of the openwisp2 ecosystem;
        			we will create a new wrapper python package (openwisp-radius)
        			that will wrap django-freeradius and add multitenancy features to it,
        			similarly to how openwisp-controller wraps django-netjsonconfig or
        			openwisp-network-topology wraps django-netjsongraph
        		</li>
        		<li>
        			the user model of openwisp-radius will reuse what is already defined
        			in <a href="https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-users">openwisp-users</a>,
        			but we need to add a way to easily define additional
        			fields that user may need (think about social security number, badge ID, ecc)
        			by using a Profile model. We'll need to figure out in which module is
        			better to add this feature
        		</li>
        		<li>
        			integrate openwisp-radius in ansible-openwisp2 as an optional module;
        			since some users will want to install only openwisp-radius we will need
        			to change the ansible role so that openwisp-controller can be disabled
        			if needed; we may decide to implement the logic of openwisp-radius
        			in a sub-role that becomes a dependency of ansible-openwisp2 if we feel
        			this makes maintenance easier
        		</li>
            <li>keep test coverage of django-freeradius at 100%</li>
            <li>keep documentation of django-freeradius up to date</li>
        		<li>achieve test coverage of openwisp-radius of 100%</li>
        		<li>
        			ensure the README of openwisp-radius is in line with
        			the quality of the  openwisp2 modules
        		</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="openwisp-ipam">openwisp-ipam: IP Address Management module for OpenWISP 2</h2>
        <p><strong>Languages &amp; technologies used:</strong> python, django, django-rest-framework, javascript.</p>

        <p>This project idea consists in creating a new OpenWISP 2 IPAM module with the
           basic features for IP Address Management.</p>

        <p>The project is divided in 2 phases.</p>

        <h4>Phase 1: django-ipam</h4>

        <p>This project idea consists in creating a django reusable app which provides
           the common features for IP Address Management:</p>

        <ul class="ui bulleted link list">
        <li>IPv4 and IPv6 IP address management</li>
        <li>Section / Subnet management with nested subnets</li>
        <li>Automatic free space display for all subnets</li>
        <li>Visual display for a specific subnet</li>
        <li>IP request module (similar to phpipam)</li>
        <li>RESTful API to for CRUD operations (using session authentication and django model permissions for authorization)</li>
        <li>Possibility to search for an IP or subnet</li>
        <li>CSV Import and Export of subnets and their IPs (using the same format of phpipam)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The django app must have also the following traits that will be needed for the second phase:</p>

        <ul class="ui bulleted link list">
        <li>abstract abase models</li>
        <li>reusable views for its API</li>
        <li>reusable admin classes</li>
        <li>reusable test classes (as in django-netjsongraph and django-freeradius)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Phase 2: openwisp-ipam</h4>

        <p>In this phase we will integrate <em>django-ipam</em> with the rest of the OpenWISP 2 ecosystem</p>

        <p>This will require creating a module called <em>openwisp-ipam</em> which will wrap
        and integrate django-ipam in the rest of the OpenWISP 2 ecosystem,
        in a very similar way as <a href="https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-controller">openwisp-controller</a>
        integrates <a href="https://github.com/openwisp/django-netjsonconfig">django-netjsonconfig</a>,
        and <a href="https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-network-topology">openwisp-network-topology</a>
        integrates <a href="https://github.com/netjson/django-netjsongraph">django-netjsongraph</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Measurable outcomes:</strong></p>
        <ul class="ui bulleted link list">
        <li>complete items described in phase 1</li>
        <li>complete items described in phase 2</li>
        <li>provide good documentation for django-ipam in form of a README.rst (using ResStructuredText), explaining how to install, run tests, configuration details, screenshots and explanation of the main features</li>
        <li>provide basic developer documentation for openwisp-ipam in form of a README.rst (using ResStructuredText), explaining how to install and run tests</li>
        <li>achieve a test coverage higher than 90% in both modules</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="netjsongraphjs">netjsongraph.js: canvas and geographic data</h2>
        <p><strong>Languages &amp; technologies used:</strong> javascript, ES6, CSS, netjson and a bit of python and django in the last phase.</p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/interop-dev/netjsongraph.js">netjsongraph.js</a> is a javascript library based on d3 that allows visualization of
        <a href="http://netjson.org/docs/what.html#networkgraph">NetJSON NetworkGraph objects</a>.</p>
        <p>
        	The library uses SVG for visualization, which can be quite slow when many elements are shown,
        	therefore we would like to try switching to canvas.<br>
        	We also need an optional mode in which the network is displayed on a map.</p>
        <p>
        	We aim at building something like <a href="https://regensburg.freifunk.net/meshviewer/#/en/graph">mesh viewer</a>
        	with the difference that this is a library and not an application.<br>
        	We want to give developers the possibility to implement features like those of mesh-viewer
        	in their application without reinventing the weel <b>BUT</b> we also want to integrate
        	these features in OpenWISP 2, infact we are already using the current <i>netjsongraph.js</i> version
        	in our network topology module, for more information see
        	<a href="https://github.com/netjson/django-netjsongraph">django-netjsongraph</a> (which is
        	the base module wrapped by <a href="https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-network-topology">openwisp-network-topology</a>).
        </p>
        <p><strong>Measurable outcomes:</strong></p>
        <ul class="ui bulleted link list">
        <li>Rewrite the visualizer to use canvas</li>
        <li>Add an optional map mode</li>
        <li>
        	Real time updates: refactor/change the javascript API so it becomes
        	easy to update the network topology graph as updates are received from the server
        </li>
        <li>
        	Provide a well written but short example in the README of how to use the
        	<i>real time update</i> feature to update the graph using websockets
        </li>
        <li>
        	Add support for date parsing, for example "2018-02-12T10:00:00Z" should be
        	converted to the date, time and time zone used by the browser.
        </li>
        <li>Modernize javascript code organization:
        	you may want to use some modern JS tool for building the library and perform testing
        </li>
        <li>Achieve test coverage of 90%</li>
        <li>Update the travis build so that it automatically runs tests, style checks and test coverage</li>
        <li>Update documentation and examples in README</li>
        <li>Explain how to migrate from the previous version to the new version in the README</li>
        <li>Upgrade the netjsongraph.js version in <a href="https://github.com/netjson/django-netjsongraph">django-netjsongraph</a>, ensuring everything works!</li>
        <li>Release netjsongraph.js on npm</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="netengine">netengine: pull monitoring info from network devices</h2>
        <p><strong>Languages &amp; technologies used:</strong> python, NetJSON, SNMP, HTTP, OpenWRT, Linux.</p>

        <p>
        	Netengine is a python library that aims to provide a single API
        	to extract common information from network devices using different protocols
        	(eg: SNMP, SSH, HTTP) and different firwmares (eg: OpenWRT, AirOS).
        </p>

        <p>
        	The library kinda worked but was not brought to production level work
        	and since OpenWISP 2 is going to have a monitoring system soon, wa want
        	to rewrite this library to bring its implementation to production level.
        </p>

        <p>
        	<strong>NOTE</strong>: backward compatibility does not have to be maintained
        	we can freely change and improve the API and internal structure of the library
        	if we think the change is going to improve the quality of the implementation.
        </p>

        <p>
        	<strong>WARNING</strong>: to work on this project you need an AirOS device;
        	OpenWRT/LEDE can be installed in a virtual box VM, but AirOS cannot (at least
        	not as easily). If you don't have an AirOS device compatible with the latest
        	version and you do not indend to buy one you cannot work on this project.<br>
        	If it ever happens that you get accepted but you fail to buy an AirOS device,
        	you will be failed.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Measurable outcomes:</strong></p>

            <li>
        			improve documentation: at the moment the documentation is really scarce,

        <p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible">Ansible</a> is an IT automation tool that has been recently
        gaining popularity also in the <a class="reference external" href="http://openwrt.org">OpenWRT</a> world.</p>
        <p>We want to implement an ansible plugin that integrates <a class="reference external" href="http://netjsonconfig.openwisp.org">netjsonconfig</a>
        and allows using its two most interesting features, that is templates and context, in ansible.</p>
        <p>It should be possible to define configuration templates, assign them to specific playbooks and define

        <h2 id="netjson-ubus">Implement NetJSON output in ubus (OpenWRT/LEDE)</h2>
        <p><a href="http://netjson.org">NetJSON</a> is emerging as a common format to exchange configuration and monitoring information
        from network devices. Year after year it's becoming easier to achieve interoperability between different software packages
        for community networks. Now is time to start implementing NetJSON in a lower level of the stack and the next
        natural step in that direction is to implement it in <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/ubus">ubus (OpenWrt micro bus architecture)</a>,
        which is included by default in <a href="http://www.lede-project.org/">LEDE</a> and <a href="https://openwrt.org/">OpenWRT</a>, the two linux distributions
        commonly used with OpenWISP.
        </p>
        <p>In this project the student will have to develop ubus API extensions that allow retrieving monitoring informatio in NetJSON format
