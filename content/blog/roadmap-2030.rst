For the past 13 years, I have had the privilege of contributing to
OpenWISP and growing alongside this community. During this time, I have
continuously collected feedback from users, contributors, and partners,
reflecting on the long-term direction required to keep open-source network
management at the cutting edge.

I have synthesized these years of notes and community dialogue into a
structured vision for the coming years: the `Roadmap to 2030
<https://openwisp.io/docs/dev/general/roadmap-2030.html>`_.

This roadmap outlines the technical and strategic paths I intend to pursue
to ensure OpenWISP remains a capable, accessible, and versatile system for
modern, heterogeneous networking environments.

Key Strategic Themes
--------------------

1. **Frictionless deployment**: Move toward a day-one ready approach by
   simplifying installation workflows and providing clear, sensible
   default configurations that work out of the box.
2. **Refined user experience**: Improve the interface of core modules so
   that frequent operations, such as device onboarding, configuration,
   monitoring, and firmware upgrades, are intuitive and accessible, even
   for users with limited technical background.
3. **Community-driven feature parity**: Address long-standing feature
   requests from the community and reduce functional gaps compared to
   proprietary network management solutions.
4. **Ecosystem agnosticism**: Expand support beyond OpenWrt by improving
   compatibility with other operating systems and adopting standard
   protocols such as NETCONF, YANG, TR-069, and TR-369. This will allow
   OpenWISP to manage a wider range of hardware and software platforms,
   making it useful to a larger audience.

Help Us Build the Future
------------------------

While this roadmap represents my personal vision for the project, it can
only be realized through collective effort. We are actively seeking:

- **Technical contributions**: Help us implement these architectural
  changes, `start contributing
  <https://openwisp.io/docs/dev/developer/contributing.html>`_!
- **Funding and sponsorship**: Financial support is vital to accelerate
  development and ensure long-term sustainability. Consider `sponsoring
  OpenWISP <https://openwisp.org/sponsorship/>`_.
- **Community feedback**: I invite you to read the `full roadmap document
  <https://openwisp.io/docs/dev/general/roadmap-2030.html>`_ and share
  your thoughts in the dedicated `GitHub Discussions thread
  <https://github.com/orgs/openwisp/discussions/1183>`_ to help refine
  these goals.

I welcome your feedback to help shape the roadmap and make this vision a
reality!
