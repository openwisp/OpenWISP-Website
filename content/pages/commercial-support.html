                <p>
                  We appreciate your interest in customizing OpenWISP, but our

                </p>
                <p>
                  While we provide comprehensive assistance and guidance for
                  using OpenWISP and troubleshooting issues, we are not an
                  organization specialized in providing code training. Our
                  support focuses on resolving technical issues, optimizing
                  system performance, and ensuring the effective deployment of
                  OpenWISP within your infrastructure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We also cannot offer support for OpenWISP extensions developed
                  by third parties. If you choose to implement customizations
                  independently, it becomes challenging for us to provide
                  assistance, and we prefer to refrain from assuming any
                  responsibility in such cases, as we don't have control over
                  the code being written.

                  proprietary tools and processes that enable us to fine-tune
                  and automate our support offerings. These tools are integral
                  to our operations and constitute valuable trade secrets that
                  we are unable to disclose or share with other organizations.

                  While we are more than willing to assist you with deploying
                  your initial OpenWISP instance and providing guidance on its
                  configuration and usage, we are unable to offer training to
                  develop services which could potentially compete with our own
