                  OpenWISP is ideal for small teams managing large networks on a
                  budget, particularly those who prefer open-source, free
                  software solutions. It is well-suited for organizations that
                  prioritize open-source network management, companies building
                  custom products, and users in emerging markets seeking
                  affordable solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For sufficiently large networks, traditional network
                  management vendors often require significant investment, while
                  OpenWISP can achieve similar goals at a fraction of the cost,
                  while also offering greater flexibility and customization.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Organizations deploying hotspot networks, municipal WiFi, or
                  those familiar with
                  <a href="https://openwrt.org/" target="_blank"
                    >Linux OpenWrt</a
                  >
                  will find OpenWISP especially useful.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, OpenWISP may not be the best fit for very small
                  networks (fewer than 20 devices), organizations lacking IT
                  expertise, or enterprises seeking open-source alternatives
                  solely for cost-saving purposes.

                <p>
                  Yes, OpenWISP can work with devices that do not run OpenWrt,
                  but some features may require adaptation. OpenWISP supports
                  standard protocols like SSH, SNMP, and APIs, which allow it to
                  manage different types of network devices. While OpenWrt
                  offers tighter integration and broader compatibility with all
                  of OpenWISP's features, other devices can still benefit from
                  the platformâ€™s monitoring, IP management, and automation
                  capabilities with appropriate configuration.

              <div class="text">
                <p>
                  Certainly! OpenWISP is widely recognized as an open-source
                  solution for WiFi Hotspot Management in public Wi-Fi
                  environments.
