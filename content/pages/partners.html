              Ubisoft, a leading creator and publisher of interactive
              entertainment, relies on automated network management and
              provisioning to support its extensive IT network infrastructure.
              By integrating OpenWISP since 2020 into their operations, Ubisoft
              has enhanced the efficiency of managing their network resources,
              streamlining processes that would otherwise require significant
              manual effort.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a result, Ubisoft can focus on delivering high-quality gaming
              experiences while maintaining robust and scalable network
              operations that meet the demands of a global audience.

              The Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a program designed to
              introduce newcomers to open-source software development.
              Participants are mentored by experienced developers from various
              open-source organizations and receive a stipend from Google for
              their contributions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since 2017, OpenWISP has participated as a mentoring organization
              in GSoC, guiding new contributors to successfully implement
              several new features and improvements to the OpenWISP network
              management system.
            </p>
            <p>
              OpenWISP's involvement in GSoC is a testament to its long-term
              commitment to open-source development.

              The WiFimetropolitano project, launched in 2008 (formerly
              ProvinciaWiFi) by the Metropolitan City of Rome, has been critical
              for the initial development and adoption of OpenWISP in its early
              days. Launched to provide free Wi-Fi access across public spaces,
              it aims to bridge the digital divide in the region.
            </p>
            <p>
              This initiative facilitates connectivity through numerous access
              points and integrates existing networks from various institutions.
              By fostering collaboration with private entities,
              WiFimetropolitano enhances public internet access and promotes
              digital inclusion across the metropolitan area.
