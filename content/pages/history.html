              <p>
                In the summer of 2008, the Metropolitan City of Rome embarked on
                an ambitious mission to bridge the digital divide by providing
                free public Wi-Fi across its expansive territory, encompassing
                Rome and 120 other cities, serving approximately 4.5 million
                inhabitants.

                The project, initially known as ProvinciaWiFi and later renamed

              <p>
                From its inception, WiFi Metropolitano embraced an open
                philosophy, advocating for open software, operating systems, and
                knowledge sharing. Collaborating with the university consortium
                CASPUR, later acquired by CINECA, the project pursued innovative
                methodologies for network distribution, enabling the utilization
                of non-dedicated network infrastructures for public connectivity
                services.

                Throughout 2009, OpenWISP played a pivotal role in the expansion
                of ProvinciaWiFi, transforming it into a network boasting
                thousands of active hotspots and users daily.

                The success of the collaboration between the Province of Rome

                By 2012, OpenWISP had expanded its role in public WiFi
                management, utilizing OpenWISP to help create FreeItaliaWiFi, a
                national federation of public administrations. This initiative
                enabled citizens to use the same credentials to access WiFi
                networks across Italy. CINECA managed around 2,500 WiFi access
                points, serving more than 300,000 users across 20 public
                administrations.

              <p>
                In 2015, we initiated the redesign of OpenWISP to address
                limitations in scalability, flexibility, and adaptability that
                emerged as network management needs evolved. The original
                system, while effective for public Wi-Fi and Hotspots, needed to
                grow to support a wider range of use cases and network
                infrastructures. This reinvention was driven by the need for a
                more modular and extensible platform, capable of managing
                diverse and large-scale networks. Over the course of a few
                years, this effort resulted in a robust, future-proof system
                that powers networks across the globe today.
